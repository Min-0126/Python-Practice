# Dictonary is a mutable collection of many values
# Can use many different data types
# Compose with 'key' and 'value'
# Use key to find value     (Mapping)

my_cat = {'size' : 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'age':17}
# my_cat['size']     -> 'fat'


# Dictonaires are unordered. It is just group of variables
# Therefore, the order of dictionary key-value pairs doesn't matter
